    <p> Giant pandas (often referred to as simply “pandas”) are black and white bears. In the wild, they are found in
        thick bamboo forests, high up in the mountains of central China These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But
        whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts for 99 percent of their diet.Pandas
        eat fast, they eat a lot, and they spend about 12 hours a day doing it. The reason: They digest only about a
        fifth of what they eat. Overall, bamboo is not very nutritious. To stay healthy, they have to eat a lot—up to 15
        percent of their body weight in 12 hours—so they eat fast.The reason: They digest only about a
