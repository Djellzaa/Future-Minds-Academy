            <h1 id="p1">Project 1- Dafi's Cake Project</h1>
            <p>The project centered around boosting a private company's image and advertising. It involved creating a
                special logo, a fun promo video, good-looking cover pages, and an informative booklet. I used programs
                like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and Premiere Pro to make these things. This made the
                company's look much nicer and their promotional stuff more appealing.</p>

        <section>
            <p><strong>The Logo, Cover Page, and Brochure</strong> should exude a consistent aesthetic, as the intention
                is for them to seamlessly complement each other. This entails ensuring that both elements share a warm
                and inviting color scheme and overall ambiance.</p>

            <p><strong>The video</strong> is made up of two separate videos that work together in perfect harmony to
                create the effect of a single video. Also, there's an audio track that's perfectly timed to match the
                actions and events in the video.<br> This synchronization between the two videos and the audio adds to
                the overall impact and makes the entire viewing experience feel seamless and unified.</p>

            <p>The project aimed to generate static and dynamic reports, as well as the integration of data from one
                table to another.</p>
            <p>As you see in the photos below, the first photo shows a static report, where the data is generated
                according to the customer's request,<br>
                while the second photo shows the successful integration of the data from the first table to the second
                table in the created database</p>
