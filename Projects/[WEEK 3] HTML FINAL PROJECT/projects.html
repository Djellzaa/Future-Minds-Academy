            <h2 id="p1">Project 1- Dafi's Cake Project</h2>
            <p>The project centered around boosting a private company's image and advertising. It involved creating a
                special logo, a fun promo video, good-looking cover pages, and an informative brochure.<br> I used programs
                like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and Premiere Pro to make these things. This made the
                company's look much nicer and their promotional stuff more appealing.

            <p><strong>The Logo, Cover Page, and Brochure</strong> should exude a consistent aesthetic, as the intention
                is for them to seamlessly complement each other.<br> This entails ensuring that both elements share a warm
                and inviting color scheme and overall ambiance.

            <p><strong>The video</strong> is made up of two separate videos that work together in perfect harmony to
                create the effect of a single video. Also, there's an audio track that's perfectly timed to match the
                actions and events in the video.<br> This synchronization between the two videos and the audio adds to
                the overall impact and makes the entire viewing experience feel seamless and unified.

            <p>The project aimed to generate static and dynamic reports, as well as the integration of data from one
                table to another.
                As you see in the photos below, the first photo shows a static report, where the data is generated
                according to the customer's request,while the second photo shows the successful integration of the data
                from the first table to the second table in the created database
